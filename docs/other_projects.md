# Inspiration from other projects

This is a list of known projects (commercial and open source) that have lots of different security integrations. Ideally we can use these to ensure we have parity between the services they integrate with and use it as a barometer to prioritize plugin development.

## High Priority/Parity Services

Things in this category should be watched fairly closely for trends. Most of these have to do with automation, or SOAR type of functions. Ideally enrichr can get integration parity is reached on each one of these projects.

## Security focused integrations

These are different security tools or products that hook into third party applications. In essence they are doing enrichment or some sort of security product integration.
